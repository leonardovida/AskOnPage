# AskOnPage - Chrome Extension

AskOnPage is a tiny Chrome extension that allows you to ask questions directly on any webpage using small embedding models from [transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js)

How does it work in three steps:

- Ask complex questions directly on any webpage, think CMD+F search.
- Get answers highlighted in the text as you would normally, but to these complex answers and not only words that match.
- Upcoming: Ask more questions about it (uses GPT3.5-turbo)
